## Overview

From his role in marketing & sales, Brian had tried many different PR database offerings and found them unsatisfactory.

Existing dashboards often had out-of-date contact data, and a hard to use user experience.

Brian approached Deca Labs early on to be the primary technology partner to build a solution.

Over 5 months, Deca Labs delivered:

- robust website crawling to collect up-to-date contact data
- an enterprise-grade backend for indexing and a flexible retrieval API
- a mobile-friendly modern dashboard for query of contact data by users
- integration with Stripe for recurring user payments
- admin dashboard UI so founder could operate the app without devs
- deployed the entire infrastructure extremely cost-effectively to enable ongoing SaaS profitability
- robust CI/CD and parallel crawling infrastructure to support safe, fast deployments, and ongoing crawling capabilities
- uptime monitoring, metrics, and alerting to ensure ongoing observability and operational excellence

Pressbook was able to launch a successful SaaS in record time thanks to the technical expertise and execution of Deca Labs.
