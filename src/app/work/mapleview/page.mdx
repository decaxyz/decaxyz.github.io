## Overview

Canada lacked a polished government regulator portal, or even a third-party dashboard to make research and monitoring of company disclosures and financial documents effortless for investors and market participants.

Mapleview Fintech approached Deca Labs early on to be the primary technology partner to build a solution.

Over 2 years that they were involved, Deca Labs delivered:

- robust website crawling to download, index, and cache all historical and ongoing documents from the government portal
- an enterprise-grade document management service for ongoing search and categorization of documents
- a mobile-friendly modern dashboard for investors to use to discover companies, monitor existing watchlists, and quickly view new documents 
- admin dashboard UI so management could operate the app without devs
- deployed the entire infrastructure extremely cost-effectively given the 1TB+ of initial data being managed
- robust CI/CD and parallel crawling infrastructure to support safe, fast deployments, and ongoing crawling capabilities
- uptime monitoring, metrics, and alerting to ensure ongoing observability and operational excellence

Mapleview Fintech was able to achieve what initially seemed technically impossible thanks to the technical expertise and execution of Deca Labs.

*For privacy reasons, the CEO requested anonymizing both their name and the company name in this portfolio profile.*
